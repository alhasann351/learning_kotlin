Arithmetic Operators -
1. Addition (+) → (a + b)
2. Substruction (-) → (a - b)
3. Multiplication (*) → (a * b)
4. Division (/) → (a / b)
5. Modulus (%) → (a % b)

Relational Operators -
1. Equal to (==) → (a == b)
2. Not equal to (!=) → (a != b)
3. Greater than (>) → (a > b)
4. Less than (<) → (a < b)
5. Greater than or equal to (>=) → (a >= b)
6. Less than or equal to (<=) → (a <= b)

Unary Operators -
1. Unary Plus (+) → a = +5
2. Unary Minus (-) → b = -5
3. Increment (++) → x++
4. Decrement (--) → y--
5. Logical NOT (!) → !flag

Assignment Operators-
1. Assignment (=) → (x = 10)
2. Addition Assignment (+=) → (x += 5)
3. Subtraction Assignment (-=) →	(x -= 3)
4. Multiplication Assignment (*=) → (x *= 2)
5. Division Assignment (/=) → (x /= 4)
6. Modulo Assignment (%=) → (x %= 3)

Logical Operators -
1. AND (&&) → Logical AND if both are true → (10 < 20 && 20 > 5) true
2. OR (||) → Logical OR at least one is true → (10 == 10 || 20 < 10) true
3. NOT (!) → Logical NOT invert the result → !(10 > 20) true
