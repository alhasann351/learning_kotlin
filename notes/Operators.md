Arithmetic Operator -
1. Addition (+) → (a + b)
2. Substruction (-) → (a - b)
3. Multiplication (*) → (a * b)
4. Division (/) → (a / b)
5. Modulus (%) → (a % b)

Relational Operator -
1. Equal to (==) → (a == b)
2. Not equal to (!=) → (a != b)
3. Greater than (>) → (a > b)
4. Less than (<) → (a < b)
5. Greater than or equal to (>=) → (a >= b)
6. Less than or equal to (<=) → (a <= b)
